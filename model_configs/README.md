## Encoder LSTM
The encoder information is a ``.txt`` file with the following information:

    line 1: embeddings size
    line 2: learning rate
    line 3: dropout probability
    line 4: Optimizer
    line 5: number layers
    line 6: hidden layers size
    line 7: batch size

## Output FNNs
Each of the output FNNs (Execution time, Power and Energy) information is a ``.txt`` file with the following information:

    line 1: embeddings size
    line 2: learning rate
    line 3: dropout probability
    line 4: Optimizer
    line 5: number layers
    line 6: size of first hidden layer
    ... (repeats line 6 for each hidden layer)
